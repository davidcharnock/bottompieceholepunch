This is an alternative to the bottom piece for the Prusa Coivd-19 faceshield.

This model is designed to allow you to use a standard office hole punch to cut the holes in the middle of the bottom of the transparent sheet.

Punch the holes as you would a normal sheet of paper then slide into this part until the holes line up.
